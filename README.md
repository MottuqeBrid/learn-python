# Python Learning Workspace

This repository documents my Python learning journey with daily exercises, projects, and practice scripts.

## Overview

This is a comprehensive collection of Python exercises organized by learning days (Day 3 through Day 54+), covering various concepts and programming challenges.

## Directory Structure

- `day-3/` to `day-54/` - Daily Python exercises and projects
- `1/`, `2/` - Initial practice scripts
- `data/` - Data files for exercises and projects

## Progress

Currently working through **54+ days** of Python programming exercises, covering topics such as:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and modules
- Object-oriented programming
- File I/O operations
- Data structures
- API integration
- Web scraping
- And more...

## How to Run

Navigate to any day's directory and run the Python scripts:

```bash
cd day-XX
python main.py
```

Or run directly from the workspace root:

```bash
python day-XX/main.py
```

## Purpose

This workspace tracks my Python learning progress through:

- Daily coding exercises
- Hands-on projects
- Real-world problem solving
- Building a strong foundation in Python programming
